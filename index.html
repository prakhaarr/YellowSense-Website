                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>Our vision is centered around "Financial Inclusion for BHARAT," and to realize this goal, we have
                    created a unique hybrid model that combines consumer technology(consumer-tech) with financial
                    technology (fin-tech). Currently, we are tackling the pressing issue of non-availability of
                    domestic househelps in India using Generative AI and Machine Learning.<br><br>

                    Through our predictive
                    analytics-driven platform, we can instantly locate maids and cooks in a user's vicinity, making the
                    process highly efficient and user-centric. This consumer-tech aspect ensures that customers can book
                    skilled professionals tailored to their specific preferences and requirements, all powered by
                    ChatGPT 3.5 LLM.</p>

                <h3>Our Aim</h3>

                <p>Beyond our consumer-tech roots, we are also venturing into financial technology by
                    developing a credit enablement platform. This platform utilizes Generative AI and leverages the
                    Government of India's OCEN framework (Open Credit Enablement Framework).<br><br> By doing so, we are
                    forging
                    a dependable bridge between lending providers and underprivileged individuals, such as maids, in
                    need of financial support. This fin-tech component plays a vital role in addressing the significant
                    $330 billion untapped market within the highly disorganized domestic service sector. <br><br>
                    In summary, our innovative approach merges cutting-edge consumer-tech capabilities, driven by
                    Generative AI and machine learning, to provide real-time access to skilled professionals.
                    Simultaneously, we are harnessing fin-tech solutions, utilizing the OCEN framework, to empower
                    underprivileged workers with small-scale loans, ultimately driving financial inclusion in BHARAT.

                                It's a good practice to book a maid in advance to ensure availability, especially during
                                peak hours. We recommend
                                booking at least 24 hours in advance, but we will do our best to accommodate last-minute
                                requests.
